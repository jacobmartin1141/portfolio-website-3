	</nav><!--This beginning section of the page, including the header and navigation bar, I would often change on one page and then have to copy paste those changes onto the other. The same thing would often happen with the footer, so I'm just wondering if there's a way to reference it as an external page, like with css???-->

	<main><!--I think, personally, it's really cool I can host my old games on here for my friends to play! I know it doesn't send quite the right message to employers (or maybe it does?) so I'll probably make it into a secret link or something that I can share with them, like an html page with no links to it from the home page, so I have to share the link...?-->
		<h3>This page contains links to some of the games I made using Scratch (Extra credit much?)</h3>
		<p>Scratch is designed around playing, developing and sharing your programs with other users online, through their servers.
			And though it doesn't have any built in exporting system, some users have created a file converter which essentially put
			the game, all it's sounds and art and the engine itself into one giant file, allowing you to play them in any browser!<br>Here's a <a href="https://sheeptester.github.io/htmlifier/" target=*-blank*>link</a> to that project. Thanks a lot, guys!</p>

          <h3>Game #1: Boomerang Warrior</h3>
          <p>This is the second to last game concept I tried to develop very seriously. I particularly focused in on the graphics and special effects, and the games overall polish. It's probably the most complete Scratch project I've ever made, even though it literally doesn't have an ending... Or a way to lose... Or to win...</p><img src="images/boomerang-screenshot.PNG" width="700" alt="A screenshot of the game. There is a green lizard character in the center, surrounded by robots of varying sizes."><p>In this game, you play as the green lizard in the center of the screen, and the aim of the game is to try and stop the robot army from reaching you using your trusty boomerang. You aim the boomerang by holding down the left-mouse button (which also shows the predicted flight path of the boomerang) and then release it to throw the boomerang and that chosen path.<br>While the boomerang is flying through the air, you can press the left mouse button again to make it fly at super speeds, giving you more control over the timing of it's flight path.<br>To open the game in a new tab, click the link below:</p>

          <p>I planned on adding character movement and power ups, but I retired the project to focus on learning real development engines when I realized I couldn't export a .exe file (still waiting on the independent project of that one...).</p>

          <h3>Game #2: Untitled Race car Game</h3>
          <p>This one's a little more involved, and a lot less finished. I never even incorporated a system for spawning enemies endlessly so it's basically unplayable, just a demo of some unfinished ideas.</p><img src="images/racecar-screenshot.PNG" width="700" alt="A screenshot of the game. There is the player's car to the left, mushroom like enemies the the right, a trail of coins above and a speedometer at the bottom right."><p>This game actually has three control sets (get out your pen and paper):</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The arrow keys, which controls your car...</li>
            <li>"WASD" and "IJKL", which controls the shape of the level...</li><!--The spell checking thought that WASD and IJKL were both misspelled, because they aren't words...? Please take this into account on second review. I also hope the spell checker won't check these comments, because I'm really not paying that much attention because I think this is a pretty big waste of time...-->
            <li>And the mouse, which creates enemies when clicking on the level, and coins when clicking off the level.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Pressing up on the arrow keys makes the car jump, and the left and right keys make you drive in either direction. You can jump onto enemy's heads like Mario, which will make you bounce off them high into the air, each bounce launching you higher than before.<br>The amount of damage you deal to enemy's is based on how high you bounced, so the longer you can bounce without missing an enemy will finish enemy's faster.<br>While in mid air, you can also press the space bar to drop bombs, which was the first power up I planned to implement. You have a limited number of bombs to drop, but killing enemy's gets you more.<br>Coins don't do anything.</p>

          <p>I planned on having many different types of enemies and multiple levels, which would include destructible elements so they would evolve as you played. This is one game I'd still like to finish one day, because I think the car's controls are a lot of fun, particularly when bouncing from one enemy to the next.</p>
