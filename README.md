# portfolio-website-3

This is my portfolio website I made as a school project some time in November of 2020.
I'm keeping it up for nostalgia, because it also includes some games I made as a kid. Games playable here: https://jacobmartin1141.github.io/portfolio-website-3/my-games-list.html
I may come back and update it at some point. No solid plans ATM.
